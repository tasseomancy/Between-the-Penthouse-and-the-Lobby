# Between-the-Penthouse-and-the-Lobby
Hi, sorry, folks, there seems to be a minor malfunction with your elevator... 

Twelve women, friends and strangers, happen to get into the same elevator. Enroute to important engagements, everyone has life decisions to make. Nobody’s plans for the day included getting stuck in an elevator, but everyone now has the chance to pause, talk to some of the people who matter the most, get advice from strangers, and grapple with what to do next.

This game is about life-long relationships and new connections, major decisions, conflicting expectations among people who love each other, and the many different viewpoints women have about what it means to be a good friend, family member, mentor, creator or feminist. Being stuck in an elevator forces important conversations that might normally be private to become semi-public, and gives everyone a chance to weigh in with their opinions on other people’s problems. Topics range from serious to light-hearted; the mood is hopeful, loving, and poignant.

(This is NOT an escape room game. The focus of play is about being in the elevator, not trying to get out of it.)

Game will run approximately three hours, plus time for setup and debrief. The characters all identify as female, but players of any gender are welcome.
